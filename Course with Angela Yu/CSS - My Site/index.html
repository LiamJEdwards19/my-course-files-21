        <p class="one">I started learning to code when I was 17 years old at college because I wanted to gain a lot of
        experience in writing code to make such beautiful websites. <br>
        I also hope to build at least 5 blog websites for myself. </p>

        <h3>Singing & Confidence</h3>
        <p>But my best skill is actually singing.I've been singing since I was 5 or 6.
          It was when I was 11 when I realised that every time I sang, my confidence started to get
          stronger and stronger until one day I would go on stage without being so nervous. Obviously you
          will still get a little nervous, but that only shows you are willing to go out there and give
          it everything you got. Well that was me alright. By the time I got to 15 and 16, I entered
          two talent shows, both of which I came second.</p>
